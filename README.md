# Linux Kernel Analysis Project

Welcome to the Linux Kernel Analysis project, where we delve into the intricacies of the Linux kernel source code.

## Background

The Linux kernel is an open-source operating system kernel that plays a crucial role in modern computing. While its source code is accessible to all, delving into its details can be quite challenging. Additionally, the number of kernel engineers is on the decline. This project aims to provide a valuable resource for individuals, including myself, who have a deep interest in the Linux kernel and are seeking comprehensive materials for study.

## Environment Setup

The project is based on the source code from Yocto Linux. Not only you can use
GDB with qemu, but also learn Yocto build system, which is popular in Embedded
industry.

### Yocto Version

Yocto Kirstone

### Linux Kernel Version

Linux Yocto - 5.15.129
